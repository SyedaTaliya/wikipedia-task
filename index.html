        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Battle of Churubusco</h1>
        <div class="main">
            <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
            <p>The Battle of <a href="#">Churubusco took place></a> on August 20, 1847, while Santa Anna's army was in
                retreat from the
                Battle of Contreras or Battle of Padierna during the <a href="#">Mexican–American War</a>. It was the
                battle
                where the San
                Patricio Battalion, made up largely of American deserters, made their last stand against U.S. forces.
                The
                U.S. Army was victorious; outnumbering more than two-to-one, the defending Mexican troops. After the
                battle,
                the U.S. Army was only <a href="#">5 miles (8 km)</a> away from Mexico City. About 50 of the captured
                San
                Patricio's were
                later hanged.</p>

        <h1 id="back">BACKGROUND</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Following their defeats at Contreras Antonio de Padua María Severino López de Santa Anna y Pérez de Lebrón
            ordered Major General Nicolás Bravo Rueda with the Army of the Center to retreat from San Antonio to
            Churubusco.[1]:296 Santa Anna also ordered Major General Manuel Rincón to hold the Franciscan Convent of San
            Mateo in Churubusco, with earthworks and seven guns, and placed General Francisco Pérez on the tete-de-pont
            on the south bank of the river.[1]:296 Two regiments were placed along the river while the convent included
            the Bravo Battalions of the Mexico City National Guard and the San Patricio Battalion, plus Santa Anna
            formed a reserve along the highway to the north.[1]:296</p>

        <h1 id="bat">Battle</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>sent <a href="#">David Twiggs</a> and Gideon Johnson Pillow's Divisions from San Angel to Coyoacán, while he
            ordered William
            Jenkins Worth to turn the San Antonio position.[1]:296 Worth sent Colonel Newman S. Clarke's Brigade and
            Lieutenant Colonel <a href="#">Charles Ferguson Smith's</a> Light Battalion across the Pedregal lava field
            to the west of
            San Antonio, while Colonel John Garland faced San Antonio on the south.[1]:297

            During retreat from San Antonio, the Mexican defenders (part of the 1st Line of Defense (or sometimes the
            "Army of the Center") with <a href="#">Colonel F. Villarreal</a> and about 2,000 men: 700 of the "Hidalgo,"
            500 of the
            "Victoria" (Lieutenant Colonel P. Jorrin) National Guards Battalions, and 800 others: under Colonels A.
            Zerecero and J. G. Perdigón Garay), were struck in flank by Clarke's Brigade. Garland moved forward as the
            Mexicans withdrew from San Antonio and captured a General and four guns.[1]:297

            <a href="#">Scott</a> ordered an attack on the convent.[1]:297 In addition to the stone walls of the
            convent, the defenses
            included a series of incomplete trenches the Mexicans had begun digging prior to the attack.[4] Some
            elements of the Tlapa and Lagos <a href="#">Battalions</a> arrived as reinforcements. Three cannon were
            placed on the right;
            two in the center; and the remaining two on the left. Independencia was assigned to defend the upper walls,
            the right flank leading to the bridge, the unfortified south and north sides, and two adobe huts further
            forward on the battlefield. The Bravos and the San Patricios were stationed on the left, behind barricades.
            In support along the <a href="#">Rio Churubusco</a> was the Pérez Brigade: 2,500 men (11th Line, 1st, 3d &
            4th Light
            Infantry Regiments).
            <img src="images/wik-map.jpg">

            Worth's division took on the tete-de-pont, while Twiggs' the convent.[1]:298 Rincón's gunners were able to
            force <a href="a">Taylor's</a> battery to withdraw,[1]:298 and Perez's defense on the tete-de-ponte twice
            repulsed Major
            Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville's 6th Infantry charge.[1]:298 The attack by Franklin Pierce and James
            Shields, crossing the river on the <a href="#">Coyoacan-Mixcoac</a> road in an attempt to cut off the
            Mexican retreat, was
            also stopped.[1]:298 However, Worth turned the Mexican left and crossed the river, while the 8th and 5th
            Infantry took the tete de pont.[1]:300 <a href="#">Captain Duncan</a> then set up a battery to attack the
            convent.[1]:300

            Two of the <a href="#">Mexican</a> cannons had melted and a third had fallen from its mount. Lieutenant
            Colonel Francisco
            Peñúñuri of Independencia led a handful of men in a bayonet charge and was defeated. He and Captain Luis
            Martínez de Castro, who had accompanied him, were killed in the battle. Officers from the Bravos attempted
            to raise the white flag over the convent walls on three occasions.[1]:300 They were prevented from doing so,
            however, by members of the San Patricios who feared the fate that awaited them if they were taken
            prisoner.[5] They were ultimately captured and <a href="#">court-marshaled</a> for desertion, including the
            leader, John
            Patrick Riley. U.S. Captain James Milton Smith finally stopped the fighting by putting up a white
            handkerchief.[1]:300

            <h1 id="aft">Aftermath</h1>
            The Americans captured 192 prisoners and three pieces of artillery at the tete de pont.[1]:300 They captured
            1,259 prisoners, including three Generals and the San Patricios leader Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Rosenda
            Moreno, plus seven pieces of artillery at the convent.[1]:300 They captured another 380 prisoners further up
            the road.[1]:300

            Seventy-two men of the San Patricios Battalion were court-marshaled by the United States Army as deserters.
            Two separate court-marshals were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, and another at San Ángel on 26 August.
            Fifty were sentenced to hang, having deserted after war had been declared. Those who had deserted earlier
            received 50 lashes. (See Saint Patrick's Battalion for a more complete description.)

            Scott did not continue the pursuit into Mexico City, "...willing to leave something to this republic... I
            halted our victorious corps at the gates of the city."[1]:301

            A Brigade of volunteers from New York was billeted to the convent, remaining there until September 7.</p>
